# Ubuntu Computer Setup for EDA

**Pro-tip:** There's a copy button hidden in the top-right of each code block for easy copy/pasting.

![Screen Shot of clicking on the copy button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47387/161153831-7a3ca544-0ad2-4977-aec8-92436f1a6bc5.png)

## 1. Installing the essentials

First run this in your terminal to update your sources:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Then run this to install the packages we need:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-is-python3 zsh
```

Run this command to set `zsh` as your default shell:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Close and open a new terminal and if you are prompted to make a choice, choose `q`.

### 1.1 Installing oh-my-zsh

We're going to install `oh-my-zsh` to make your terminal/shell experience a bit more pleasant.

> _Oh My Zsh_ is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for
> managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful
> functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout...

Copy this command into your terminal:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### 1.2 Configuring ZSH

Zsh installs a command `omz` to configure itself. To set your theme to "bira" run:

```sh
omz theme set bira
```

Close your terminal and open a new one.

## 2. Preparing build tools

## 3. Setup Visual Studio Code

Install _Visual Studio Code_ if it isn't already installed.

https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Then in your terminal, open _VS Code_ with:

```
code .
```

### 3.1 Installing extensions

Install the following _VS Code_ extensions:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Live Share
- vscode-icons (optional, but pretty :wink:)
- GitLens (optional)

In your terminal, run:

```shell
code --list-extensions
```

You should see the IDs of each of these extensions logged like this:

```
dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
esbenp.prettier-vscode
ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons
eamodio.gitlens
```

### 3.2 Visual Studio Code settings

In _VS Code_:

1. Click the _Settings_ cog button in the bottom left and open the _Command Palette_.
2. Type `settings.json` into the little search box that appears at the top of your screen.
3. Click on the `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` option to open your `settings.json` config file.

Paste this content after the first line (`{`):

```json
 "editor.detectIndentation": false,
 "editor.insertSpaces": true,
 "editor.tabSize": 2,
 "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": true },
 "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
 "editor.guides.bracketPairs":"active",
 "[javascript]": {
   "editor.formatOnSave": true,
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
 },
 "[javascriptreact]": {
   "editor.formatOnSave": true,
   "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
 },
 "prettier.semi": false,
 "prettier.singleQuote": true
```

**NOTE:** Each entry in your `settings.json` should end in a comma, except for the last one. If there are some existing entries you'll need to add a comma to the end of this line: `"prettier.singleQuote": true`.

### 3.3 Make VS Code your default Git editor

Run this command in your terminal:

```sh
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### 4.4 Install NVM

NVM is a tool to install and manage NodeJS versions.

First, check if you have installed NVM before:

```sh
type nvm
```

If you see something like `nvm is a shell function from /home/username/.nvm/nvm.sh` you've already installed NVM and can go to section 4.5, if you see a `nvm not found` message then keep reading.

First, check if you have NodeJS installed:

```sh
which node
```

If it logs "node not found", that's perfect. We want NVM to manage node and npm on our dev machine.

If it logs anything else (e.g. `/usr/bin/node`), you need to uninstall NodeJS, this differs depending on
how you installed it. Contact a facilitator if you get stuck.

Enter this command into your terminal to download and install NVM:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

This command will initialise NVM when you open a terminal:

```sh
cat << 'EOF' >> ~/.zshrc
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
EOF
```

Now run this command to reload your `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
omz reload
```

### 4.5 Installing Node and NPM with NVM

Install the latest "Long Term Support" (i.e. very stable) version of node:

Run this command in your terminal:

```sh
nvm install --lts
```

Then, also in your terminal, run:

```sh
nvm alias default node
```

To confirm, run this command (_We're expecting something in the `v16.x` range_):

```sh
nvm current
```

### 4.6 Building sqlite3

`sqlite3` is a database package that we use a lot during bootcamp. At this point
you should be set up with everything you need to build it.

Run this command to confirm:

```sh
npx --yes @donothing/can-u-build-sqlite3
```

If it succeeds it will log `Everything looks good`.

## 6. Cloning your first repo

We're going to clone a repo to make sure everything is working fine.

We'll start by creating a directory to keep all your repos in (_it doesn't really matter what you call it_):

```sh
mkdir ~/devacademy
```

and then change directory into it:

```sh
cd ~/devacademy
```

**For these next two commands, replace the name and email with your own details**

You'll need to configure `git` to know your name...

```sh
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
```

... and your email address. These will be recorded as the author in commits you make:

```sh
git config --global user.email "your.name@example.com"
```

If you prefer `git` to save your credentials instead of entering them each time, you can configure `git` to store them:

```sh
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Now go to your [github tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a new token:

- It can be called anything, but I use something like "home laptop"
- It needs the "repo" permissions so make sure to check that checkbox
- Set the expiration to 90 days, so that it lasts all bootcamp
- **Make sure you copy the token before you close that tab**

From your Ubuntu terminal, clone down `clone-a-repo-test`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-foundations/clone-a-repo-test.git
```

Now we're going to change into the new directory:

```sh
cd clone-a-repo-test
```

and open _Visual Studio Code_:

```
code .
```

Now you should be looking at the `clone-a-repo-test` in your editor. Click on the `README.md` file to read the hidden message.

Run this command in your terminal:

```sh
open .
```

Your file browser should open that directory.

## 7. You're all set up

```sh
npx --yes @devacademy/checklist
